                    <li>Remove the saucepan from the heat and add the flour all at once. Stir vigorously until the mixture forms a ball and pulls away from the sides of the pan.</li>

                    <li>Heat vegetable oil in a deep fryer or heavy-bottomed pot to 375°F (190°C).</li>
                    <li>Pipe 4-6 inch strips of dough into the hot oil, using scissors or a knife to cut the dough from the piping bag.</li>
                    <li>Fry the churros until golden brown and crispy, about 2-3 minutes per side. Remove from the oil and drain on paper towels.</li>
                    <li>In a shallow dish, combine sugar and cinnamon for coating.</li>
                    <li>While the churros are still warm, roll them in the cinnamon sugar mixture until evenly coated.</li>
